Graphic Pump ReadMe

The Graphic Pump is an application automating the moving of images from the Internet to a Screen Saver, Pocket PC or Digital Picture Frame. It runs on a schedule and performs simple formatting.

The application is shareware, and is fully functional.  Unregistered copies will place a small text message on the bottom of images it is pumping.  Registration can be done at:

http://www.graphicpump.com

Registering your copy will give you a registration code and access to news and upgrade information.

There are two applications that ship with the Graphic Pump.  The first is a system utility that is the main application, the second a screen saver. 

The Graphic Pump system utility application allows the user to setup Pump Tasks for execution.  

In order to define your own task, it is suggested that you run the "New Task Wizard" from the file menu.  You can then customize your task to your liking.

In summary, a Pump Task consists of four things (see the documentation for more detail).

a) A source of the images - This can be files or web images -OR- an album file which contains information about the images. Be creative here.  There are lots of sites that can store snapshots for you, and by all means pump these images onto other devices or directories.  But there are also lots of sites that expose interesting data as a "graphic".  News, weather, traffic information are all often available on the internet.
b) A schedule to run the task - This tells the application how often and when to run the task.  
c) Formatting rules for the images - This allows a target device or size to be entered
d) A destination - This can be a directory of images, a directory of images and html files, or a digi-frame (see http://www.digi-frame.com).  A directory of images can be used by a screen saver (such as the Grapic Pump Saver that was installed with this product) to display graphics.  A directory with html files can be pushed onto a small handheld device such as a PocketPC.  The uses of the digi-frame should be self evident.

There are two "sample" tasks that ship with the application.  These can be found in the "TestSource" subdirectory of the install directory of the application and can be imported using the File -> Import menu.
